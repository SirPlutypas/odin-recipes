    <h1>Slow-Cooker Thai Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This crockpot Thai chicken is a family-pleasing slow cooker recipe that's super easy to make. Start this dish in the morning, and it will be ready when you get home. Just add your favorite rice. Chicken thighs are better in this recipe than breast meat, which dries out in the crock pot; plus, thighs are more economical. The strength of the hot salsa dissipates when cooked, so this dish is not too spicy. You may even want to serve hot-sauce as an accompaniment.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) container egg whites</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups instant oats</li>
            <li>1 cup low-fat cottage cheese</li>
            <li>1 ½ scoops vanilla protein powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon stevia powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine egg whites, oatmeal, cottage cheese, protein powder, stevia, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray. Pour 1/3 cup batter into the skillet; flatten batter using the back of a measuring cup. Cook until bubbles form, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
